      "You're actually really close to getting it to work :) The way passing through a secondary GPU works is that it basically gives the VM software (in this case qemu) direct access to the graphics card - that's why you couldn't see anything in linux when you only had your dGPU plugged in to your monitor. \n\nAny output from the dGPU is going to display nothing until qemu starts up windows - so your monitor will automatically sync to where it gets video first, in this case, linux using your iGPU. By switching which graphics card output you are displaying on your monitor, you will be switching between seeing linux and windows.\n\nAlso, the reason you were still seeing windows in a little window on linux is because of the \"spice display\". This is essentially an emulated graphics card, similar to what virtualbox or vmware use - so when you saw two displays show up in windows (one being spice and the other being the dGPU), making the dGPU your primary display just moved the visible windows desktop to the dGPU output - which is visible by simply switching the monitor input. Personally, when I use gpu-passthrough I like to disable spice as I find it just ends up getting in the way.\n\nHope this helps you get your system up and running :)\n\nedit: unrelated note, are you using gpu-screen-recorder? it might help solve some of your recording issues in linux",

      "As a Linux Consultant by trade, your explanation of GPU isolation is bang-on! VFIO-PCI is a stub (placeholder) driver. One can only pass through an entire IOMMU group which can be problematic on many motherboards. Configure BIOS for IOMMU and SR-IOV, identify which IOMMU group GPU is and find out PCI ID, isolate GPU on startup through kernel parameters (blacklisting AMD/Nvidia drivers from loading), configure and install GPU driver in VM and boom, you have hw accelerated graphics. Gotta set Linux to use the internal GPU, also don't forget to enable iGPU in UEFI / BIOS! :D",

Grep is the most common way to search a piece of text in linux / the BSD operating systems; to find your Radeon RX 7700 graphics card from the output of 'lspci -nn', you would type:\nlspic -nn | grep 'Radeon RX 7700'\nNote that the symbol '|' is the \"pipe\" command, which uses the output of the previous command (\"lspic -nn\") as the first input of the next command (\"grep 'Radeon RX 7700'\").\nHope this helps save time in the future! :)",

So use hdmi for Linux and display port for windows (or whatever you got available)\n\nAlso GPU pass through is notoriously finicky on standard desktop motherboards.

For example, first, you need to config grub to transfer some boot options. Second, I may need to mkinitcpio for some early load driver.

Proxmox is a Debian-based type 1 hypervisor with an easy web interface that manages GPU passthrough without the need for complex scripts. You can run your Windows 11 VM with full GPU access for gaming or editing, and also spin up other VMs, like your configured Arch Linux, or any OS you need, with just a click. It helps avoid conflicts between Linux and the VM since Proxmox runs as the host OS. Perfect for creators—just assign your GPU to the VM, install Windows drivers, and you're ready to go!\n\nThat said, I also prefer running everything natively on Linux instead of relying too much on virtualization or Wine. I know the experience isn’t the same as running apps natively. But like you, I rely on some Windows software too, like Guitar Pro, FL Studio, and Affinity apps (the latter I use under Wine).",

The freeze at the end was because you switched your primary display/monitor, so the spice didnt get any signal anymore. Just switch the input of your monitor aswell to the DP or HDMI of your dGPU and anything should work. i wasted COUNTLESS hours myself trying to do a passthrough - but succeded. \n\nYou can even use your dGPU on your Linux AND Windows without having to reboot by detaching/reattaching it to the Linux System and using PRIME GPU offloading. As i said with looking Glass you dont even need a cable plugged into your dGPU you just use looking class on Linux to see your Windows like a window/remote.\n\nIf you need any further help let me know :).",

You could've just gone to a different TTY (Ctrl+Alt+F3 or F4 or whatever F key you want) and then login to a terminal without a GUI to fix whatever you broke before rebooting. Switching TTY with Ctrl+Alt+F# is a great way to un-stuck a linux desktop without having to force-reboot. You can run htop in a terminal to kill whatever process is locking your desktop, or go the nuclear option of running \"killall sddm\" to completely reset your display manager, and killing every app that launched from it (including your desktop). much faster than rebooting\n\nAlso why are you trying to plug an hdmi cable from your GPU to your monitor when trying to boot your VM? the GPU doesn't output to your monitor, it outputs to the VM.",

That it.\nAnd yes, VFIO with amd iGPU and dGPU is annoying due to fact, that both devices uses AMDGPU driver and you can't just blacklist it. \nStill, that one is actually a \"easy\" route, cause trying to pass iGPU will require you to dump your bios and vbios (there a trick for that, cause your iGPU doesn't actually have vbios, but using the one that bios provided) and after that you need to hookup it to VM. It is tedious as it sounds.\n31:35 also, on linux there a support for some weird iGPU passthrough shenanigans, so if you connect dGPU, you can still render image on iGPU by specifically asking vulkan to render on needed card. Works both way, but you loosing performance due to fact, that second gpu basically need to stream rendered image instead of just putting in on screen. This should also be supported on windows, but I never tried it.",
